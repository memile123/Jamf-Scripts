	Purpose: When used with Self Service, enables a non-admin user
	to change time zone on his or her Mac.
	
	• The script will offer to set the time zone automatically
	  if it detects the time zone is set manually.
	• Otherwise, the script will first present a short list
	  of commonly used time zones.
	• If selected, the script will present a full set choices
	  based on UNIX time zones.

	The script creates a log file in the user's ~/Library/Logs folder.

	"To script is admin.
	To comment divine."

INSTRUCTIONS

	1) Below, create a short list of common time zones. Include as many
	   as needed to make the script easier to use.
	2) Numbers for each time zone in the short listmust be unique
	   and sequential beginning with "1".
	3) Add this script to your Jamf Pro server.
	4) Create an ongoing Self Service item with the script and
	   enabled for offline use.
